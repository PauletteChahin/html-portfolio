<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
 Hello, get to know me a bit!<br>
  I'm someone who loves to appreciate the beauty in life, whether it's through my favorite colors of black, pink, and 
  neutrals or the stunning sight of the aurora borealis. As a Capricorn, I'm known for my ambition, discipline, and 
  practicality, but I also have a softer side that's evident in my love for dogs and tulips. When I'm not busy pursuing 
  my goals, you can often find me dancing or working out at the gym, both of which help me stay energized and focused.
  Speaking of the aurora borealis, did you know that this natural phenomenon is caused by charged particles from the 
  sun interacting with Earth's magnetic field and atmosphere? It's a breathtaking sight that's been captivating people 
  for centuries, and I feel lucky to have seen it in person. Just like the aurora borealis, I strive to bring light and 
  wonder into the world, whether it's through my passions or the way I interact with others.</p>
